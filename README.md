## Description

README.md files are a necessary tool in the developer world as it communicates the details of projects/applications. Although essential for collaborating with others, it is tedious & time consuming to create one manually. This application helps the user create a Read Me file by answering questions.

## Future development 

The ReadMe file generator is unfortunately not the best place for creativity as it should be as basic/standard as possible so it can fit into any project. 
Adding a signature and changing the color scheme could make the file more personal to the user in question.
