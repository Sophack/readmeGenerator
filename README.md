# ReadMe File Generator

## Description

README.md files are a necessary tool in the developer world as it communicates the details of projects/applications. Although essential for collaborating with others, it is tedious & time consuming to create one manually. This application helps the user create a Read Me file by answering questions. The user's input is then used to create a file with the format of a README.md file. This makes things easier for developers so they can communicate their work with others quickly and efficiently.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
